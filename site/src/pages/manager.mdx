# For Managers

## Randomized DM's

The main function of PureMOOt! When a manager uses the `/puremoot` command,
PureMOOt will generate a random pairing of people with the `cow` role. Use as
shown below:

<Command name="/puremoot [day]" admin={true} /> where it is the `[day]`th day that DM assignments are being handed out.

## Internal roles

PureMOOt has two internal roles that it keeps track of:

- Anyone who is a "manager" can use all the admin commands of PureMOOt.
    - By default, this is anyone who either:
        1. has "administrator," or
        2. has both "manage server" and "view audit log"
- Anyone who is a "cow" will be assigned to randomized DM's.

The corresponding commands are as follows:
- <Command name="/pmmanager set [roletype] [discord role]" admin={true} /> - set the internal role `[roletype]`
  (which is either "manager" or "cow") to correspond with anyone who holds the
  `[discord role]` role.
- <Command name="/pmmanager unset [roletype]" admin={true} /> - set the internal role `[roletype]` back to
  its default as described above.
- <Command name="/pmmanager get [roletype]" /> - see the discord role that corresponds to the
  internal role `[roletype]`

## Bans

PureMOOt allows managers to ban users from reaping or anonymously broadcasting.

- <Command name="/pmmanager bban" admin={true} /> - ban anonymous broadcasting on this channel.
- <Command name="/pmmanager ballow" admin={true} /> - allow anonymous broadcasting on this channel.
- <Command name="/pmmanager bpermitted" /> - see if broadcasting is permitted (non-admin)

- <Command name="/pmmanager rban [user]" admin={true} /> - ban this user from reaping on this channel
- <Command name="/pmmanager rallow [user]" admin={true} /> - allow this user to reap on this channel.
- <Command name="/pmmanager rpermitted [user]" /> - check if this user is allowed to reap on this channel.
