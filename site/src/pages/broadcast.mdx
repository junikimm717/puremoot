# Broadcasting

PureMOOt allows users to broadcast anonymous messages! When a user broadcasts a
message, they will be assigned an ID for that channel, which makes it easy to
distinguish between anonymous users.

## Regenerate a Broadcast ID

<Command name="/regenerate"/>

## Broadcast a message
<Command name="/broadcast [message]"/>

## Broadcast in a new thread

This feature was introduced because people could not anonymously respond to
Discord polls in `#polls` if the corresponding thread was not already created.

<Command name="/broadcast [message] [respondto] [threadname]"/>

- `[respondto]` is the message link for the message that you would like to respond to.
- `[threadname]` is an optional argument.
