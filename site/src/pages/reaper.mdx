# Reaper

Reaper is a game of strategy and patience where you try to gain as much time
as possible. It originated from [AoPS](https://aops.com).

1. You may reap only if either condition is satisfied:
    1. You were not the last person to reap and your cooldown expired, **or**
    2. You have a free reap, in which case that free reap will be used up.
2. When you reap, your score will usually increase by the number of seconds since the previous reap. 
3. Every time you reap, you have a 4% chance of getting a free reap. Free reaps
   can be used whenever you want with no restrictions.
4. Every time you reap, the number of seconds you reaped may randomly multiply.
   Reaper multipliers vanish if **a user reaped for more than 1 hour**.
   Probabilities are listed below:
   <div class="max-w-xs">
    |**Multiplier**|**Probability**|
    |---|---|
    |2x|4%|
    |3x|4%|
    |4x|1%|
    |5x|0.5%|
    |8x|0.1%|
