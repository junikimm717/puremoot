# For Managers

## Randomized DM's


<Command name="/puremoot [day]" admin={true}> 
The main function of PureMOOt! When a manager uses the `/puremoot` command on
the `[day]`th day, PureMOOt will generate a random permutation of people that
have the "cow" internal role.
</Command>

## Internal roles

PureMOOt has two internal roles that it keeps track of:

- Anyone who is a "manager" can use all the admin commands of PureMOOt.
    - By default, this is anyone who either:
        1. has "administrator," or
        2. has both "manage server" and "view audit log"
- Anyone who is a "cow" will be assigned to randomized DM's.

The corresponding commands are as follows:

<Command name="/pmmanager set [roletype] [discord role]" admin={true}> 
set the internal role `[roletype]` (which is either "manager" or "cow") to correspond with anyone who holds the `[discord role]` role.
</Command>

<Command name="/pmmanager unset [roletype]" admin={true}> 
set the internal role `[roletype]` back to its default as described above.
</Command>

<Command name="/pmmanager get [roletype]"> 
see the discord role that corresponds to the internal role `[roletype]`
</Command>
