# Getting Started

PureMOOt provides a whole suite of commands to enable the best possible
experience for both managers and server members!

## Inviting PureMOOt

PureMOOt is currently a private discord bot. You should contact Juni and
discuss the process of inviting it to your server!

## Self Hosting PureMOOt

Before the steps below, you should create a new Discord bot account. Per the
terms of the AGPL, it is best for the description of your bot to have a link
to the source code or this website!

The recommended approach for running PureMOOt by yourself is through docker.
Images will run standalone and contain the latest improvements.
The `docker-compose.yml` file should look something like the below:

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  puremoot:
    image: junikimm717/puremoot
    environment:
      DISCORD_TOKEN: 'token'
    volumes:
      - ./saved-redis-data:/data
```

## Developers

In order to begin contributing to PureMOOt, you will need a fairly recent
version of Node (which Astro supports), Go, and Redis. You can either install
these manually or use `nix develop` on a system with the [nix package
manager](https://nixos.org).
