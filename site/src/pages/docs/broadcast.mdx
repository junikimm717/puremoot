# Broadcast

PureMOOt allows users to broadcast anonymous messages! When a user broadcasts a
message, they will be assigned an ID for that channel, which makes it easy to
distinguish between anonymous users.

<Command name='/regenerate'>
	Regenerate a Broadcast ID in the channel that the command was sent from.
</Command>

<Command name='/broadcast [message]'>
	Broadcast a message in the channel that the command was sent from.
</Command>

<Command name="/broadcast [message] [respondto] [threadname]">
Anonymously respond to a message with link `[respondto]`, creaing a new thread in the process.

- `[respondto]` is the message link for the message that you would like to respond to.
- `[threadname]` is an optional argument.

This feature was introduced because people could not anonymously respond to
Discord polls in `#polls` if the corresponding thread was not already created.

</Command>
