# Managers

## Internal roles

PureMOOt has two internal roles that it keeps track of:

- Anyone who is a "manager" can use all the admin commands of PureMOOt.
  - By default, this is anyone who either:
    1. has "administrator," or
    2. has both "manage server" and "view audit log"
- Anyone who is a "cow" will be assigned to randomized DM's.
  - By default, this will correspond to any role with the name "cow" ignoring cases.

The corresponding commands are as follows:

<Command name='/pmmanager set [roletype] [discord role]' admin={true}>
	Set the internal role `[roletype]` (which is either "manager" or "cow") to
	correspond with anyone who holds the `[discord role]` role.
</Command>

<Command name='/pmmanager unset [roletype]' admin={true}>
	Set the internal role `[roletype]` back to its default as described above.
</Command>

<Command name='/pmmanager get [roletype]'>
	See the discord role that corresponds to the internal role `[roletype]`
</Command>

## Reaper Bans

PureMOOt managers can ban any user from reaping on a channel for misconduct, which may include:
1. Using alt accounts
2. Using a bot to automate reaping

<Command name='/pmmanager rban [user]' admin={true}>
	Ban this user from reaping on this channel.
</Command>
<Command name='/pmmanager rallow [user]' admin={true}>
	Allow this user to reap on this channel.
</Command>
<Command name='/pmmanager rpermitted [user]'>
	Check if this user is allowed to reap on this channel.
</Command>

## Broadcasting Bans

PureMOOt managers can ban users from broadcasting in a channel if it results in
abuse/spam/etc.

<Command name='/pmmanager bban' admin={true}>
	Ban anonymous broadcasting on the channel where the command was sent.
</Command>
<Command name='/pmmanager ballow' admin={true}>
	Allow anonymous broadcasting on the channel where the command was sent.
</Command>
<Command name='/pmmanager bpermitted'>
	See if broadcasting is permitted on the channel where the command was sent.
</Command>
